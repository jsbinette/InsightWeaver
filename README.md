# Notes

This is a fork of the inline-bookmarks extension by [tintinweb](https://github.com/tintinweb) (which has been translated to Typescripyt) and merged with the chat-gpt-vscode-extension by [ismailkasan] (https://github.com/ismailkasan)

The two extension offered a great start to do what I wanted to do which was to create a gpt chatbox well setup to handle large instruction sets.

## To compile this extension

Change the version in package.json, add a new entry in the changelog above, and then run the following commands:

```vsce package
```

END
